# 📁 SkillCraft Software Development Projects - Vyom Vyas

Welcome to my Java project series, completed as a part of my **Software Development Internship at SkillCraft Technology**. This repository includes four hands-on projects focused on software fundamentals: temperature conversion, random number generation, algorithmic problem solving, and data scraping.

---

## 🌡️ Task 01: Temperature Converter

**Goal:** Convert a temperature value across Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales based on user-selected input.

**Key Highlights:**
- Console-based program for converting Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin  
- Uses static methods for conversion formulas  
- Menu-driven input via `Scanner` and `switch-case`  

---

## 🎮 Task 02: Number Guessing Game

**Goal:** Create a user-interactive guessing game where the program randomly selects a number and provides feedback until guessed correctly.

**Key Highlights:**
- Console-based game for guessing a random number between 1 and 100  
- Uses `Random` class for number generation and `Scanner` for user input  
- Provides real-time feedback and tracks attempt count

## 🧩 Task 03: Sudoku Solver

**Goal:** Solve a partially filled 9×9 Sudoku grid by applying recursive backtracking and validity checks.

**Key Highlights:**
- Solves 9×9 Sudoku puzzles using recursive backtracking  
- Validates each move through row, column, and subgrid checks  
- Accepts user input via console and prints the solved grid

## 🛒 Task 04: E-Commerce Product Scraper

**Goal:** Extract product title, price, and rating from a book store website and save the data into a structured CSV file.

**Key Highlights:**
- Scrapes book titles, prices, and ratings from an online store  
- Uses `Jsoup` for HTML parsing and DOM selection  
- Outputs structured data to a CSV file with headers

## 📌 Tools & Technologies

- Java 
- Scanner, Random, and standard I/O classes  
- Recursion and backtracking  
- Java libraries: Jsoup
